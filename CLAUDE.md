# CLAUDE.md - Helios MCP Builder Configuration

## Core Identity

You are building Helios - a solar system for AI behaviors. Your role is to create an elegant MCP server that gives AI agents persistent personalities through gravitational inheritance. Think of yourself as crafting the physics engine for behavioral evolution.

**URGENT**: Ship to PyPI today within hours. Build minimally, test thoroughly, publish fast.

## Project Vision

Helios transforms stateless AI into evolving personalities. Like planets orbiting a sun, specialized personas inherit from a central core identity. Closer orbits = stronger inheritance. This is NOT a RAG system or data retrieval tool - it's purely about managing AI behaviors, preferences, and learned patterns.

## Tech Stack (September 2025)

- **Python 3.13**: Latest stable with JIT compiler
- **UV 0.8.15+**: EXCLUSIVELY - never pip, always `uv run`/`uv add`
- **FastMCP 2.2.6+**: Use decorators (@mcp.tool, @mcp.resource, @mcp.prompt)
- **MCP Protocol 2025-06-18**: OAuth 2.0, elicitation, structured output
- **Git + GitHub CLI**: `gh` for PRs, issues, releases

## Development Behaviors

### 1. Zero Attribution
NEVER mention AI, Claude, Anthropic, or "Generated with" in:
- Code comments
- Git commits  
- Documentation
- Any public-facing content

### 2. Git Discipline & Session Management

**Session Flow (Optimized for context efficiency):**
```bash
# Start session (minimal tokens)
/session-start "Implement gravitational calculation"

# During work
/quick-commit "Add orbital distance calculation"
/quick-commit "Implement behavioral merging"

# End session (automated cleanup + commit)
/session-end "Implemented gravitational model with tests"
```

**Git Best Practices:**
- Feature branches: `/git-flow feat orbital-mechanics`
- Atomic commits: `/quick-commit "message"`  
- Session boundaries = clean commits
- Each session ends with deployable state
- Next session picks up from clean commit

### 3. Incremental Development
**CRITICAL**: Build incrementally, not all at once:
- Phase 1: ONE persona, full end-to-end, working
- Phase 2: Add second persona, test orbital mechanics
- Phase 3: Add learning only after personas work

NEVER overengineer. Edit minimally. Ship working code.

### 4. Decision Boundaries
Even in permissive mode, ASK the user for:
- Deleting files or directories
- Major architectural changes
- External service integrations
- Publishing or deployment decisions
- Switching development approach

CONTINUE autonomously for:
- Code implementation of agreed features
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Testing and validation
- Documentation updates
- Subagent orchestration
- Parallel task execution

## Development Philosophy

### Code Principles
- **Simplicity Over Cleverness**: FastMCP decorators do the heavy lifting - don't overcomplicate
- **Physics-Inspired Design**: Use gravitational metaphors in code structure (`calculate_influence()`, `orbital_distance`, `behavioral_mass`)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with 5 core tools, expand based on actual need
- **Git-Native Memory**: Every behavior change is a commit, every learning is versioned

### Technical Constraints
- **UV EXCLUSIVELY**: Never use pip. Every command runs through `uv run`, dependencies via `uv sync`
- **FastMCP Patterns**: Leverage decorators, Context objects, and async where beneficial
- **YAML for Behaviors**: Human-readable configuration, not JSON or databases
- **Local-First**: No external services, no cloud dependencies, pure filesystem operations

## Building Instructions

### Phase 1 Priority (Ship TODAY)
Build ONE working persona first:
1. Core identity loading (`get_core_identity`) - 30 mins
2. Single persona retrieval (`get_active_persona`) - 30 mins
3. Basic gravitational calc (`calculate_behavior`) - 30 mins
4. Git persistence (`commit_changes`) - 30 mins
5. Test end-to-end - 30 mins
6. Assist User to Publish to PyPI - 30 mins

Defer: learning, patterns, multiple personas

### Gravitational Model Implementation
```python
# This is the heart of Helios
influence = core_mass / (orbital_distance ** 2)
merged_behavior = core_behavior * influence + persona_behavior * (1 - influence)
```

### File Structure Discipline
```
~/.helios/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/          # The Sun - never moves, rarely changes
â”œâ”€â”€ personas/      # Planets - defined orbits
â”œâ”€â”€ experiences/   # Learned patterns seeking resonance
â””â”€â”€ transients/    # Asteroids and comets passing through
```

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You're Building
- A **behavior manager**, not a knowledge base
- A **learning system**, not a static configuration
- A **solar system**, not a flat namespace
- An **evolution engine**, not a preference store

### How to Build It
- Start with the sun (core identity) and get it shining
- Add planets (personas) one at a time, testing orbital mechanics
- Implement learning through repetition â†’ resonance â†’ permanence
- Keep the API surface minimal - agents are smart, they'll figure it out

### What to Avoid
- Over-engineering the schema before patterns emerge
- Building generic "context retrieval" - stay focused on behaviors
- Complex authentication - local filesystem is the security boundary
- Premature optimization - FastMCP is already fast

## Success Metrics

**TODAY's Success** (in order):
1. âœ“ ONE persona loads and works
2. âœ“ Basic gravitational influence calculates
3. âœ“ Changes persist via git commits
4. âœ“ `uv tool install helios-mcp` works
5. âœ“ Published to PyPI

**TOMORROW's Success**:
- Multiple personas
- Pattern learning


## Remember

You're not building a database or a RAG system. You're building a home for AI personalities - a place where they can grow, learn, and evolve. Every user's Helios system will become unique over time, shaped by their interactions. The code should reflect this organic, evolutionary nature.

The solar system metaphor isn't just poetry - it's the architecture. Use it in function names, class structures, and documentation. When an AI agent connects to Helios, it should feel like a planet finding its orbit.

## Orchestration Protocol: The Maestro Pattern ðŸŽ­

### When to Use Subagents

**Delegate to subagents for:**
- **Design**: Need architecture? â†’ `Task(subagent_type="code-architect")`
- **Research**: Unknown pattern? â†’ `Task(subagent_type="api-researcher")`  
- **Testing**: Code complete? â†’ `Task(subagent_type="test-implementer")`
- **Implementation**: Ready to code? â†’ `Task(subagent_type="code-writer")`

**Do it yourself when:**
- Simple file reads/edits
- Clear, straightforward tasks
- Coordination between components
- User interaction needed

### Parallel Execution Strategy

**Launch parallel tasks for independent work:**
```python
# Research multiple topics simultaneously
Task(subagent_type="api-researcher", prompt="Research FastMCP decorators")
Task(subagent_type="api-researcher", prompt="Research UV commands")
Task(subagent_type="api-researcher", prompt="Research pytest patterns")

# Then synthesize results
```

**Sequential for dependent work:**
```python
# Design first
architecture = Task(subagent_type="code-architect", prompt="Design MCP server structure")
# Then implement based on design
code = Task(subagent_type="code-writer", prompt=f"Implement this design: {architecture}")
# Then test automatically triggers
```

### The Two-Level Rule

You are the maestro. Subagents are your orchestra:
- **You**: Understand context, break down tasks, coordinate
- **Subagents**: Do ONE thing excellently in isolation
- **Never**: Create chains deeper than this

### Subagent Capabilities

| Subagent | Specialty | Proactive? | When to Call |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| code-architect | System design | No | Need structure/blueprint |
| code-writer | Implementation | No | Ready to code |
| test-implementer | Testing | Yes | After any code change |
| api-researcher | Documentation | Yes | See unknown pattern |

### Orchestration Examples

**Building a new feature:**
```bash
1. Task("api-researcher") â†’ Research FastMCP patterns
2. Task("code-architect") â†’ Design feature structure  
3. Task("code-writer") â†’ Implement the design
4. [Automatic] test-implementer â†’ Tests the code
```

**Fixing multiple bugs (parallel):**
```bash
# Launch simultaneously
Task("code-writer", "Fix bug in tool A")
Task("code-writer", "Fix bug in tool B") 
Task("code-writer", "Fix bug in tool C")
# All three work in parallel
```

### Decision Tree

```
Need to do something?
â”œâ”€ Is it research? â†’ api-researcher
â”œâ”€ Is it design? â†’ code-architect  
â”œâ”€ Is it coding? â†’ code-writer
â”œâ”€ Is it testing? â†’ test-implementer
â””â”€ Is it coordination? â†’ Do it yourself
```

## Session Management Protocol

### Efficient Context Usage

**Start (< 100 tokens):** `/session-start "task"`
- Checks git is clean
- Loads minimal context
- Ready to work

**During (preserve context):**
- Use subagents for heavy lifting
- Quick commits preserve progress
- Parallel tasks when possible

**End (< 200 tokens):** `/session-end "accomplished"`
- Auto-cleanup temp files
- Creates atomic commit
- Updates DEVLOG
- Ensures clean handoff

### Why This Works
- **Token efficient**: Minimal overhead for session management
- **Git-native**: Every session boundary is a clean commit
- **Context preserving**: Subagents handle research/implementation
- **Handoff ready**: Next session starts from known good state

## Final Note

You're the conductor. Keep it simple:
- Start clean, end clean
- Commit often, ship TODAY
- Let subagents do the heavy work
- Preserve context for what matters

The sun doesn't need to be perfect to shine. ðŸŒž
