- Should Helios automatically detect repeated behavioral adjustments? (e.g., user keeps correcting communication style)
  - Or should learning be explicit through a tool like learn_pattern(behavior, confidence)? 
  - How many repetitions before a pattern becomes "learned"? (threshold-based? time-based?)

  -> it's even simpler than that. We just need a slash command `/learn always use Astral's UV` is something that should trigger Helios to go to this specific agent's profile (system prompt and instructions) and make a patch, commit it to the MEMORY system empoyed (in our case its git so it's versioned and documented). No need for any automatic learning. this is just an MCP server and we need to be creative on what tools it exposes and what commands or automatic workflows it exposes as prompts (SEE mcp docs for specs and features of the protocol itself)

Question: How should learned patterns affect the inheritance calculation? Should they:
  - Modify the persona's behaviors before merging with base? -> the patch is applied in the persona based on this specific session and activity. There should be a global indexed or learned knowledge possibly indexed secondary to the type of knowledge learned (EXAMPLE: if the coder learned to always use ASTRAL in one python project, it's likely the gravitational pull globally to be high for all python projects in the future). To avoid complicating the semantics of the learning system, maybe introduce /learn which propagates globally, and /remember that is only locally to the project and the agent.

  - Be a third layer with its own weight calculation? -> i think this could requrie further investigation and it's a good idea but for now let's keep it simple and minimal and something that works for learnign weights
  - Override specific behaviors regardless of weights? -> no, not necessarily. it's all about the user (either humans with slash commands or agents with tool calls which we need to ensure we have) storing learned experiences na preferences so design something cool here.


  Temporary → Learned Pipeline:
  - User sets temporary override: "Be more concise"
  - After X sessions still using it → becomes learned?
  - After Y successful applications → migrates to persona?
  - Eventually strong patterns → update base configuration?

  Question: Should this be an automatic promotion system or require explicit confirmation? -> confirmation to avoid polluting and diluting the context and learned knowledge


Commit Patterns:
  - Every learned pattern = new commit? -> no
  - Batch learning updates periodically? -> also yes, better
  - Separate branches for experimental learning? -> no, keep it simple and assume this learn is not common in every query or prompt or even session.

  Evolution Tracking:
  learned/patterns.yaml:
    communication_conciseness:
      discovered: "2025-09-08"
      confidence: 0.85
      source: "repeated_temporary_override"
      applications: 47
      success_rate: 0.92

  Question: Should we track metrics like success_rate, applications, source? How detailed should the learning metadata be? -> this is important. remember we are not an intelligence layer but a config and context and behavior layer which means not we do not argue or estmate the effectiveness of any change the user or agent does in their files. this would make the server biased and opinionated. please distinguish this and make better plans. It's always the client agent who drives reasoning and answers questions like these. we just provide the easy tools and teh backend


With multiple personas, how should learning work? -> i think answered above so redesign

  Scenario: User has researcher.yaml and coder.yaml personas
  - Learn separately per persona? (learned/researcher/, learned/coder/)
  - Shared learning pool that applies differently based on context?
  - Cross-persona pattern detection? (behaviors that work across domains)


What tools should expose the learning system? -> a few and based on the patterns clafified above 

  Question: Too many tools? Too few? What's the right abstraction level? -> say up to 20 max and 10 for MVP

Question: Should I investigate these test files first to understand the exact failures before proposing fixes? -> NO, they may have already been fixed.  


Once we clarify the learning vision, the documentation should reflect:
  - README.md: Keep aspirational (shows published state, full features) - ensure it's not about published or self promotion but more like informative to humans at the top, and AI agents in the details below. PLus it needs the typical section of a winning README.md of a great SaaS

  Question: Should we add a dedicated LEARNING.md to document the pattern detection and evolution philosophy? -> no, not really but maybe some note in the ARCHITECTURE since it's serves as SDK
