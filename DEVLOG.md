# Helios MCP Development Log

## Session: 2025-09-07_Production_Ready

**Task:** Complete Phase 1 implementation and prepare for PyPI

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed critical server bugs (mcp.list_tools(), inheritance_weight)
- ✅ Created CLI entry point with Click (`helios-mcp` command)
- ✅ Refactored to factory pattern (no global state)
- ✅ Added lifecycle management (health checks, graceful shutdown)
- ✅ Professional README inspired by Context7
- ✅ Repository cleanup (removed test files from root)
- ✅ All 7 MCP tools working:
  - get_base_config, get_active_persona, merge_behaviors
  - list_personas, update_preference, search_patterns, commit_changes
- ✅ UV-based installation: `uvx helios-mcp`
- ✅ Created QUICKSTART.md for testing

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Factory pattern for server creation
- CLI handles stdio properly for MCP protocol
- Logging to stderr only (stdout reserved for MCP)
- Health monitoring configurable (60s default)
- Git auto-initialization in config directory

**Test Status:**
- 36/50 tests passing (72%)
- Main issue: Inheritance bounds clamping (0.99 vs 1.0)
- Tool function tests have mock issues
- Core functionality works correctly

**Ready for:**
- PyPI publication as `helios-mcp`
- Claude Desktop integration testing
- User feedback and iteration

**Next Session Focus:**
1. Fix remaining test failures (get to 100%)
2. Verify Claude Desktop integration
3. Publish to PyPI
4. Begin Phase 2 (learning patterns)

## Session: 2025-09-07_Initial

**Task:** Project setup and configuration

**Completed:**
- Updated tech stack to September 2025 standards
- Configured FastMCP 2.2.6+ with Python 3.13
- Set up UV 0.8.15+ as exclusive package manager
- Created focused subagents for specialized tasks
- Established orchestration protocol (Maestro Pattern)
- Created session management commands
- Refined inheritance model terminology (removed planetary metaphors from technical implementation)

**Changes:**
- Updated PLAN.md with modern tech stack and inheritance terminology
- Updated PRD.md with architecture details and inheritance model
- Updated README.md with current practices and configuration examples
- Fixed .python-version to 3.13
- Enhanced dev-setup.sh script
- Configured uv.toml properly
- Created 4 specialized subagents
- Added /session-start and /session-end commands
- Configured settings.json and settings.local.json
- Updated all agent configurations to use inheritance terminology
- Updated coding style guide to focus on practical software engineering

**Next Steps:**
- Initialize UV project with `uv init --python 3.13`
- Create src/helios/server.py with FastMCP instance
- Implement core MCP tools (get_base_config, merge_behaviors)
- Add git persistence
- Test with one persona
- Publish to PyPI
