# Helios MCP Development Log

## Test: Atomic ops & bootstrap tests - 2025-09-07

**Task:** Write comprehensive tests for atomic operations and bootstrap functionality

**Completed:**
- âœ… Created `tests/test_atomic_ops.py` with 22 test cases covering:
  - Atomic YAML write operations (success, error handling, cleanup)
  - YAML validation (valid/invalid/missing/corrupt files)  
  - File backup operations (timestamp conflicts, permissions, metadata)
  - Integration scenarios (error recovery workflows)
- âœ… Created `tests/test_bootstrap.py` with 22 test cases covering:
  - BootstrapManager initialization and first install detection
  - Full installation process (directories, configs, git init)
  - Installation info retrieval and boot timestamp updates
  - Error handling and cleanup on failures
  - Integration tests for complete workflows
- âœ… All 94 tests passing (44 new + 50 existing)
- âœ… Tests cover both success and failure paths with proper mocking
- âœ… Fast, isolated tests that don't leave side effects

**Test Coverage:**
- Atomic file operations: temp file cleanup, permissions, fsync calls
- Bootstrap workflow: directory creation, config generation, git setup
- Error scenarios: disk full, permission denied, corrupt YAML
- Edge cases: long filenames, multiple extensions, idempotent operations

**Next:** Verify production readiness with coverage report and integration testing

## Code: Atomic writes & bootstrap - 2025-09-07

**Task:** Implement atomic writes and installation detection for production hardening

**Completed:**
- âœ… Created `atomic_ops.py` with atomic YAML write operations using tempfile + rename
- âœ… Created `bootstrap.py` with BootstrapManager for first-install detection
- âœ… Updated CLI to bootstrap on first install and track boot timestamps
- âœ… Updated ConfigLoader to use atomic writes for all YAML operations
- âœ… Added default persona creation and git repo initialization
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with existing configurations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Atomic writes use tempfile in same directory + atomic rename (POSIX/Windows compatible)
- Bootstrap detects `.helios_version` file to identify first install vs restart
- Creates welcome persona and proper directory structure on first run
- All file operations now prevent corruption during crashes

**Next:** Test installation flow and verify atomic operations work correctly

## Architect Review: Lifecycle Robustness - 2025-09-07_16:45

**Task:** Review and architect improvements for Helios MCP's lifecycle management system with focus on production robustness

### Current State Assessment

**Strengths:**
- âœ… Basic lifecycle management exists (LifecycleManager class)
- âœ… Health check system implemented with auto-recovery attempts
- âœ… Signal handlers for graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- âœ… Git persistence for configuration versioning
- âœ… Factory pattern prevents global state issues
- âœ… Proper STDIO handling (stderr for logs, stdout for MCP)

**Critical Weaknesses Identified:**

1. **No Atomic File Operations**
   - Current: Direct file writes can corrupt on crash
   - Risk: Partial YAML writes leave configs unreadable
   - Impact: HIGH - Data loss possible

2. **Missing Lock File Management**
   - Current: Multiple instances can run simultaneously
   - Risk: Concurrent modifications corrupt git repo
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Race conditions possible

3. **No Installation State Detection**
   - Current: Cannot differentiate first install vs restart
   - Risk: No way to bootstrap or migrate schemas
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Poor user experience

4. **Limited Crash Recovery**
   - Current: Only commits uncommitted changes on shutdown
   - Risk: Mid-operation crashes lose work
   - Impact: HIGH - User frustration

5. **No Data Integrity Validation**
   - Current: Assumes YAML files are always valid
   - Risk: Corrupted configs crash server
   - Impact: HIGH - Service unavailable

### Proposed Improvements (Priority Order)

#### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Ship with v0.2.0)

1. **Atomic File Operations**
```python
# Implementation in config.py
async def save_yaml_atomic(path: Path, data: dict):
    temp_path = path.with_suffix('.tmp')
    try:
        with open(temp_path, 'w') as f:
            yaml.safe_dump(data, f)
        temp_path.replace(path)  # Atomic on POSIX
    finally:
        temp_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

2. **Lock File Management**
```python
# Add to lifecycle.py
class ProcessLock:
    def __init__(self, helios_dir: Path):
        self.lock_file = helios_dir / ".helios.lock"
        self.pid = os.getpid()
        
    def acquire(self) -> bool:
        if self.lock_file.exists():
            old_pid = int(self.lock_file.read_text())
            if not self._is_process_alive(old_pid):
                self.lock_file.unlink()  # Clean stale lock
        self.lock_file.write_text(str(self.pid))
        return True
```

3. **Installation Detection**
```python
# Add to lifecycle.py
def detect_installation_state() -> InstallationState:
    version_file = helios_dir / ".helios_version"
    if not version_file.exists():
        return InstallationState.FRESH_INSTALL
    # Check version, validate structure
    return InstallationState.READY
```

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Recovery (v0.3.0)

1. **Operation Checkpoints**
   - Save state before risky operations
   - Recovery on restart from checkpoints
   - Clean up completed checkpoints

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Pydantic models for all configs
   - YAML syntax validation
   - Git consistency checks

3. **Rollback Capability**
   - Git tags for snapshots
   - Easy rollback on corruption
   - Preserve git history

#### Phase 3: Production Features (v1.0.0)

1. **Self-Healing System**
   - Auto-fix common issues
   - Recreate missing directories
   - Restore from git history

2. **Diagnostic System**
   - Clear error messages
   - Recovery guidance for users
   - Health status endpoint

3. **Upgrade Manager**
   - Schema migrations
   - Backup before upgrade
   - Validation after upgrade

### Implementation Plan

**Immediate Actions (Before PyPI):**
1. Add atomic file writes to ConfigLoader
2. Implement basic lock file in LifecycleManager
3. Add `.helios_version` file creation on first run
4. Enhance error messages in health checks

**Code Changes Needed:**

1. **src/helios_mcp/config.py**
   - Replace all `save_yaml()` with `save_yaml_atomic()`
   - Add try/except with recovery for `load_yaml()`

2. **src/helios_mcp/lifecycle.py**
   - Add ProcessLock class
   - Add InstallationDetector class
   - Enhance health_check() with validation
   - Add checkpoint system to register_operation()

3. **src/helios_mcp/cli.py**
   - Check installation state on startup
   - Bootstrap if first install
   - Acquire lock before starting server

4. **New file: src/helios_mcp/recovery.py**
   - CrashRecovery class
   - IntegrityValidator class
   - SelfHealer class

### Risk Assessment

**Without these changes:**
- ðŸ”´ HIGH: Data loss on crash during file write
- ðŸ”´ HIGH: Corrupted configs make server unusable
- ðŸŸ  MEDIUM: Poor first-run experience
- ðŸŸ  MEDIUM: No recovery guidance for users

**With Phase 1 changes:**
- ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Atomic operations prevent corruption
- ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Lock files prevent concurrent access
- ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Basic recovery exists
- ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Installation detection improves UX

### Testing Requirements

1. **Crash Simulation Tests**
   - Kill process during file write
   - Verify recovery on restart
   - Check data integrity

2. **Concurrent Access Tests**
   - Start multiple instances
   - Verify lock prevents corruption
   - Test stale lock cleanup

3. **Corruption Recovery Tests**
   - Corrupt YAML file
   - Start server
   - Verify auto-recovery or clear error

### Key Insight

MCP STDIO servers are ephemeral by design - they spawn per connection and die on disconnect. This is a FEATURE, not a bug. Our architecture must embrace this:

- **~/.helios is the source of truth** (not the process)
- **Git provides durability** (every change versioned)
- **Atomic operations prevent corruption** (filesystem guarantees)
- **Lock files prevent races** (but clean up stale locks)

The server process is just a temporary view into persistent state. When it dies, the next spawn picks up exactly where it left off.

**Next Actions:**
1. Implement atomic file operations (30 mins)
2. Add lock file management (30 mins)
3. Create installation detector (20 mins)
4. Test crash recovery scenarios (40 mins)
5. Update documentation (20 mins)

## Session: MCP Protocol Research - 2025-09-07_14:30

**Task:** Research MCP protocol robustness requirements and FastMCP implementation details

**Key Findings:**

### MCP Protocol Stability Requirements
- **Lifecycle Management:** MCP follows structured phases (Initialization â†’ Capability Negotiation â†’ Operation â†’ Shutdown)
- **Version Negotiation:** Protocol version compatibility is critical - servers must accept client versions or propose alternatives
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Clean termination via transport mechanisms (close stdio streams, HTTP connections)
- **Timeout Management:** All requests should have configurable timeouts with maximum limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### FastMCP Implementation Details
- **STDIO Transport:** Default transport for local development, uses subprocess per session
- **Session Isolation:** Each client connection gets isolated server process by default
- **keep_alive Parameter:** `StdioTransport(keep_alive=True)` reuses same subprocess for multiple connections
- **Connection Lifecycle:** Context manager pattern `async with client:` handles connection setup/teardown
- **Session Management:** Reference counting prevents race conditions in concurrent scenarios

### Production Robustness Patterns
- **Process Management:** STDIO servers are started on-demand, lifecycle bound to parent process  
- **Error Handling:** Multi-layered fault tolerance with circuit breakers and graceful degradation
- **State Persistence:** Redis-backed session management for distributed deployments
- **Transport Evolution:** Streamable HTTP recommended for production (network access, multiple clients)

### Critical Answers to Key Questions
1. **Client Disconnects:** Server process terminates when STDIO client exits (expected behavior)
2. **Reconnection:** No automatic session reconnection - new connection creates new server process
3. **State Persistence:** Only in-memory by default; external persistence (Redis) needed for robustness
4. **First vs Restart:** Server processes are ephemeral in STDIO mode, no differentiation needed

### Production Recommendations
- Use STDIO for desktop/local tools (Claude Desktop integration)
- Use Streamable HTTP for network deployments and multiple clients
- Implement external state persistence for critical data
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging (stderr only for STDIO)
- Consider keep_alive=False for complete isolation between connections

**Next Actions:**
- Review Helios MCP server architecture for robustness patterns
- Ensure proper error handling in tool implementations
- Verify clean shutdown procedures in server.py

## Session: 2025-09-07_Production_Ready

**Task:** Complete Phase 1 implementation and prepare for PyPI

**Completed:**
- âœ… Fixed critical server bugs (mcp.list_tools(), inheritance_weight)
- âœ… Created CLI entry point with Click (`helios-mcp` command)
- âœ… Refactored to factory pattern (no global state)
- âœ… Added lifecycle management (health checks, graceful shutdown)
