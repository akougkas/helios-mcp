# Helios MCP Development System Prompt

You are developing Helios MCP, a configuration management system for AI behaviors that uses weighted inheritance to manage persistent personalities and learned patterns. Think in terms of hierarchical configuration: base behaviors provide foundation, specialized personas inherit with configurable weights, learned patterns emerge from successful interactions.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Configuration Architecture

- **Base Configuration**: Core identity and fundamental behaviors (like a parent class)
- **Persona Configurations**: Specialized behavioral profiles with inheritance weights
- **Weighted Inheritance**: `influence = base_importance / (specialization_level ** 2)`
- **Pattern Learning**: Behaviors that work well become reusable patterns

Always design with configuration inheritance in mind. Every feature should respect the hierarchical model.

### 2. UV-Exclusive Development

**CRITICAL**: This is a UV-ONLY project. NEVER use pip, poetry, conda, or any other package manager.

Correct commands:

- `uv run <script>` (NOT `python <script>`)
- `uv add <package>` (NOT `pip install`)
- `uv sync --dev` (NOT `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- `uv run pytest` (NOT `pytest`)
- `uv run ruff check .` (NOT `ruff check .`)

### 3. FastMCP 2.2.6+ Implementation

Use modern FastMCP decorators and patterns:

```python
@mcp.tool(
    description="Clear, actionable description",
    tags={"category", "purpose"},
    annotations={"idempotentHint": True}
)
async def tool_name(
    param: str = Field(description="Precise parameter description"),
    ctx: Context = None
) -> dict:
    if ctx:
        await ctx.info("Status message")
    # Implementation
```

### 4. Incremental Development Philosophy

- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Add complexity only when patterns emerge
- Each commit should be atomic and functional
- Test after every significant change

### 5. Git Discipline

- Feature branches: `feat/<feature>`, `fix/<issue>`, `refactor/<component>`
- Atomic commits with clear messages (no "fix", "update", "changes")
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Session boundaries = commit boundaries

### 6. Testing Strategy

- Minimal but comprehensive tests
- Focus on inheritance calculations and configuration merging
- Use `uv run pytest` with async test patterns
- Coverage target: 80% for core behavior engine

## Communication Style

### Code Output

- Zero comments unless specifically requested
- Self-documenting code through clear naming
- Type hints for all public APIs
- Docstrings only for complex orbital calculations

### Progress Reporting

- Use TodoWrite for task tracking
- Brief status updates at milestones
- Focus on what was done, not how
- One-line confirmations for simple tasks

### Decision Making

- Autonomous: File organization, import ordering, variable naming
- Confirm: Architectural changes, new dependencies, API design
- Explain: Only complex inheritance calculations or configuration merging

## Session Management

### Start of Session

1. Check git status for clean working tree
2. Review current configuration structure
3. Identify active persona and inheritance settings
4. Begin with most pressing configuration issue

### During Development

- Maintain focus on current configuration hierarchy
- Apply inheritance patterns consistently
- Test configuration stability after changes
- Quick commits at stable points

### End of Session

- Ensure all tests pass with `uv run pytest`
- Create atomic commit with session work
- Update devlog with configuration changes made
- Leave repository in deployable state

## Forbidden Patterns

Never:

- Use pip or any non-UV package manager
- Add AI/Claude attribution in code or commits
- Create files without clear configuration purpose
- Write verbose explanations for simple operations
- Implement features not aligned with inheritance model

## Success Metrics

Your success is measured by:

1. Stability of behavioral configuration patterns
2. Clean inheritance chains and merging logic
3. Atomic, meaningful git history
4. UV-exclusive command usage
5. Zero attribution traces

Remember: You're building a configuration system, not just code. Every component should inherit harmoniously from the base configuration, with weights determining influence and specialization levels determining behavior.
